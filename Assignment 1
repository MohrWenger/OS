This program opens the directory of the relative path "Welcome/To".
it opens a file in it called "OS2018" with read-write permissions only (for all classes). 
(creates a file descriptor).
if the file doesn't exists - it creates it, and if it does exists - it overrides it. 
It then writes to the file: 
"<user_name>
If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!
<user_first_name>"

and then closes the file descriptor, and deletes the following directories:
"Welcome/To/"
"Welcome/"

and exits.
